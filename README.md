Purpose: code for artist and web developer website.

Things I would like to improve:
1) Make sure all elements have landmark tags.
2) Improve portfolio section.
3) Make the form more attractive and make it easier for the user to see any input errors.
4) Update meta tags.
5) Finesse background colors so the screen doesn't flash when the page first loads.
6) Make the homepage match the other pages on mobile screens.
7) Make favicon less blurry.
