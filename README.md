Purpose: code for artist and web developer website.

Things I would like to improve:
1) Improve color contrast for footer.
2) Make sure all elements have landmark tags.
3) H1 consistency across the pages, especially on the web developer page.
4) Improve portfolio section.
5) Make the form more attractive and make it easier for the user to see any input errors.
6) Create favicon and/or logo.
7) Update meta tags.
8) Finesse media queries.
9) Make sure all of my images have alt tags.
10) Finesse background colors so the screen doesn't flash when the page first loads.
11) Make the homepage match the other pages on mobile screens.
12) Add contact form.
