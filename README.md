Purpose: code for artist's and web developer website.

Things I would like to improve:
2) H1 consistency across the pages, especially on the web developer page.
3) Perhaps use relational database to store exquisite corpse input.
4) Make the form more attractive and make it easier for the user to see any input errors.
