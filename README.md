Purpose: code for artist and web developer website.

Things I would like to improve:
1) Make sure all elements have landmark tags.
2) Make the form more attractive and make it easier for the user to see any input errors.
3) Finesse background colors/images so the screen doesn't flash when the page first loads.
4) Improve deployment
