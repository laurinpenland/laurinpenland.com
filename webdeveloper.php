	<h2>Web Developer</h2>

	<p>I love to build beautiful, efficient, and responsive websites.</p>

	<p>Much of my work is related to libraries and archival collections. One of my current projects is to improve user experience in the <a href="https://archives.lib.duke.edu/">Rubenstein Library's collection guide platform</a>. The platform is based off of the open source projects <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/projects/arclight">ArcLight</a> and <a href="https://projectblacklight.org/">BlackLight</a>.
  <h2>Portfolio</h2>
  <p>You can view a few of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/laurinpenland">GitHub.</a></p>
	<h3>Finding Family in Archives at Duke</h3>
	<p>For a capstone project in an advanced CSS and HTML class, I created a website that helps people research their ancestors in the archives at Duke. The website is meant to be warm and welcoming. The design is inspired by photographs and letters found at the library.</p>

	<h3>Archival Supplies</h3>
	<p>For a capstone project in advance scripting and markup, I built a website using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) stack. I used Express to create an API, and the site includes reactive forms, behavior subjects, and observables. For the design, I used Bootstrap, Angular Material, and custom CSS. The purpose of the site is to show the different kinds of archival supplies used by the staff at the Rubenstein Library.</p>
