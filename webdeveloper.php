	<h2>Web Developer</h2>

	<p>I love to build beautiful, efficient, and responsive websites.</p>

	<p>I work in an archive and much of my work is related to libraries and archival collections. One of my current projects is to improve user experience in the <a href="https://archives.lib.duke.edu/">Rubenstein Library's collection guide platform</a>. The platform is based off of the open source projects <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/projects/arclight">ArcLight</a> and <a href="https://projectblacklight.org/">BlackLight</a>.
  <h2>Portfolio</h2>
  <p>You can view a few of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/laurinpenland">GitHub.</a></p>
	<h3>Finding Family in Duke Archives</h3>

	<figcaption>Website that helps genealogists find family members in the archival collections at Duke. The site is meant to be warm and welcoming, and to help researchers feel comfortable performing basic searches in the library's catalog and collection guides.</figcaption>

	<h3>Archival Supplies</h3>

	<figcaption>I built this website for my capstone project in an advanced markup and scripting course. The site uses the MEAN (MongoDB, Node.js, Angular, and Express). I also used Bootstrap and Angular Material to style some of the views. The data was pulled from an Access database that I created as part of my work at the Rubenstein Library.</figcaption>
