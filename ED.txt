The river is cold and green and strong and
what next
Overthinking, brain heavy, lying down.\n$nextLine0
dishes piling up, no excuse. I love
to love anything but myself
tell me anything but don't tell me that
my britches have fallen and that my moon shines brightly
but what do I care, for I live in accordance with the moon spirit
and to live is more than most of us can afford
especially in this late-stage capitalist neoliberal hellscape 





here I am, I fixed something


what can i say. It's friday, it rained
the rain cleansed my soul and brought out the worms
I was a bad boy yesterday, but the rain washes away all of my past deeds
but it can't wash away the memory circles of my mind
but it can't wash away the memory circles of my mind
